Scrimba Module 2 - first personal project - hometown homepage
This is the first project that we are given to do on our own inthe Scrimba frontend path course.
I had a lot of fun making it, and you can probably see that i am a noob, but i am happy 
that i managed to do it without following a tutorial :)

I did have one issue that i didnt manage to figure out, and that was to give the images and the gif at the
bottom a hover function. I have made hover functions before so i did do it the right way, but somehow it didnt work,
so it must be something in my code that is the reason for that. As of now, they are not meant to have a hover function, i removed it.
Maybe i will add it later when i have more experience :)
